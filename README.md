# Integrative Analysis of Rare Variants and AlphaGenome-Predicted Regulatory Impacts within Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Genes

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis code and summary-level results for our study investigating the predicted regulatory impacts of rare variants enriched in Alzheimer's disease (AD) within 85 AD-associated genes. We analyzed 1,801,711 rare variants (MAF < 1%) from 24,595 ADSP WGS participants and used [AlphaGenome](https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphagenome/) to predict variant-level regulatory effects across 11 functional modalities, identifying 9,943 unique variants (AC >= 3) mapped to gene regions.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.8
- pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, intervaltree, statsmodels
- PLINK 2.0 (Phase 1 variant extraction)
- PLINK 1.9 (Phase 3 frequency analysis)

## Data Access

Individual-level genetic data are from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) WGS Release 4 and are available through [NIAGADS](https://adsp.niagads.org/) upon approval. See `data/README.md` for details.

Gene-level and variant-level summary statistics are included in this repository under `data/` and `results/`.

## Note on Code Paths

All analysis code was executed on the Indiana University high-performance computing (HPC) environment. File paths in the code reference that specific infrastructure. To reproduce the analysis, update paths to match your local data locations.
